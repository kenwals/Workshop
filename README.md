# Workshop

This repository is from a Javascript workshop course i did in Crumlin College (Dublin,Ireland) in early 2020. 

In class we wrote little javascript programes and ran them in a Chrome browser. We displayed results on the console of the Developer Tools in the browser. 

Due to Covid 19 lockdown , i didn't get to complete the 12 week course. Course was postponed and then cancelled . 

But in the few classes we had, i did get a good understanding of how Javacript stores data as objects and interacts with JSON files.
